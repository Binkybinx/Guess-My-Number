# Guess-My-Number

- **Understanding the DOM**:  
  - The *Guess My Number* project helped me understand the DOM (Document Object Model) as the structure that represents the HTML elements of a webpage.
  - I learned that the DOM allows me to interact with and manipulate the content and structure of a webpage dynamically using JavaScript.

- **Selecting and Manipulating DOM Elements**:  
  - I learned how to use the `querySelector()` method to select specific elements in the DOM, which allows me to target individual HTML elements by their ID, class, or other attributes.
  - I gained hands-on experience using the `value` property to get input values (e.g., from form elements) and the `textContent` property to get or change the text of elements in the DOM.

- **Handling Events with addEventListener**:  
  - I used the `addEventListener()` method to add event listeners to elements, such as detecting clicks on buttons.  
  - By passing a function to handle events like the `click` event, I was able to make the page interactive and respond to user actions (e.g., starting a new game, submitting a guess).

- **Manipulating CSS Styles Dynamically**:  
  - I learned how to change CSS styles directly in JavaScript, allowing me to provide real-time feedback to users (e.g., changing background colors or widths).
  - I practiced modifying elements' appearance based on game outcomes (e.g., turning the background green for a correct guess).
